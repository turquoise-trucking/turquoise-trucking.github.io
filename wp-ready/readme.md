# What are wp-ready files?

These are flattened (tabs removed, not quite minified) HTML files containing the navbar element and page content. **Do not use these as a single source of truth**. Instead the HTML files in the root directory of the repository are to be modified when needed. 

## How do I deploy these?

Copy these directly into each page via the WordPress dashboard.

## How are these created?

Copy the navbar (with active styling) and page content from a newly created or modified page into a new HTML file in this directly. Remove indenting and empty line breaks except for a blank line at the end and two links between the navbar element and page content.

Login to the WordPress dashboard and create a new page. Copy this files contents into it and adjust metadata for the page accordingly.
