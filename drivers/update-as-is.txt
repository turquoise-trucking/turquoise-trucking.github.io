Originally, I wanted to add some text to the CD and OO pictures like this:

<div class="card text-white">
  <img src="7004-flag-wide.jpg" class="card-img" alt="...">
  <div class="card-img-overlay" style="background: linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(0,0,0,0) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0.20) 75%);">
    <p class="card-title display-4">Company Drivers</p>
  </div>
</div>

With a gradient added for better readability. But, on mobile the text is too large. Instead of adding some styling to hide it or alter it, easier to remove the text so it becomes this.
