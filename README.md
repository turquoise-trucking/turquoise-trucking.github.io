## Masthead no longer fluid

To prohibit the masthead from stretching and breaking the background image I've changed the masthead container from *container-fluid* to simply *container*. A max-width class was also added to the masthead to limit width to 1400px. A white, semi-transparent gradient was also added to give the black logo text some contrast on wider screens.
